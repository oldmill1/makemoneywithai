I use GPT-Codex-5.3 for the big stuff. It's $25/month or $120/month for unlimited. I throw architecture decisions, large refactors, anything that needs reasoning at it.

I had TypeScript files that needed reorganizing. Sent the context to Codex with "here's the structure, here's the problem, propose a refactor." Got back a solid plan — specific files to move, module boundaries, everything.

For back-and-forth work, I use Cognition's SWE 1.5 Fast model. Cheap, fast, good for questions and small fixes.

Example: building a menu component, wasn't sure about control flow. Asked "can the caller control the callee — can the person calling control what items are in the IGMenu." Got a clear answer with code. Snappy conversation.

The split: Codex for complex work ($120/month), SWE 1.5 Fast for everything else. Costs less than Claude monthly subscription and works better for what I'm doing.
