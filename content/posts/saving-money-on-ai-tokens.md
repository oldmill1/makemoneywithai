If you're paying full price for Claude or GPT-4, you're overpaying. I tested a bunch of alternatives and landed on a simple rule: use the right tool for the job.

For big, complex queries where you need deep reasoning, use GPT-Codex-5.3. The promo pricing is absurd — $25/month or $120/month unlimited. That's next-gen level AI for basically nothing. I throw my architecture decisions, my large refactors, anything that needs real thought at it.

Example: I had a bunch of TypeScript files that needed reorganizing. The structure was messy, dependencies were tangled. I sent the whole codebase context to Codex-5.3 with "here's our structure, here's the problem, propose a refactor." Got back a solid plan with specific files to move, new module boundaries, everything. One query. Done.

For the back-and-forth stuff, use Cognition's SWE 1.5 Fast model (promo price). It's flying under the radar. Good for questions, clarifications, small fixes, debugging. Fast enough that it feels conversational.

Example: I was building a menu component and wasn't sure about control flow. "Can the caller control the callee — like, can the person calling control what items are in the IGMenu?" I asked. Got a clear answer with code examples. The back-and-forth was snappy, like talking to a developer.

The math is simple: Codex-5.3 for the heavy lifting ($120/month all-you-can-use), SWE 1.5 Fast for everything else (way cheaper per query). Way less than paying full price for Claude every month.

Most people don't even know these exist. They're stuck paying $20/month for ChatGPT or blowing hundreds on Claude API. These two, combined? Better results, less money.
