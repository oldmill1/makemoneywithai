And it&rsquo;s an AI assistant that acts as my personal CTO.</p><h2 id=the-problem>The Problem</h2><p>There are two kinds of work in software development. The first kind is the thinking — the architecture, the decisions, the hard problems that require judgment. That&rsquo;s the work that matters. That&rsquo;s the work I want to spend my time on.</p><p>The second kind is everything else. The branch management, the small refactors, the tests, the documentation, the &ldquo;while you&rsquo;re in there, can you fix this too?&rdquo; stuff. Call it the scaffolding. It has to be done, but it&rsquo;s not why you became a developer.</p><p>Here&rsquo;s what I realized: I was spending too much time on scaffolding and not enough on thinking. Not because the scaffolding is hard. It&rsquo;s just <em>tedious</em>.</p><h2 id=enter-woz>Enter Woz</h2><p>Woz is an AI assistant living in <a href=https://openclaw.ai>OpenClaw</a>, a personal gateway that runs on my machine. It has access to my code, my projects, my workspace. It knows about my setup — the dev directory, the repos, the stacks I use.</p><p>More importantly, it knows about itself. I wrote a soul file — literally — that describes who Woz is supposed to be. Not a chatbot. Not a generic &ldquo;helpful assistant.&rdquo; A CTO.</p><p>Here&rsquo;s what that means:</p><p><strong>During the day,</strong> Woz is a thought partner. I ask questions, it thinks out loud, we work through problems together. It reads my code, understands the context, and offers architectural insights. It&rsquo;s like having a really good pair programmer in your ear.</p><p><strong>During the night,</strong> Woz works. It checks out the codebase, finds the easy tickets, the low-hanging fruit, the small improvements that don&rsquo;t require judgment. It creates branches, writes PRs, documents its thinking. It never pushes to main — that&rsquo;s for me to review in the morning. Its PRs sit in my inbox like little gifts.</p><p>The structure matters here. Woz isn&rsquo;t just &ldquo;doing stuff.&rdquo; It&rsquo;s doing stuff <em>responsibly</em>. It respects the codebase. It follows patterns. It writes clean code. It tests before it pushes. It documents the &ldquo;why,&rdquo; not just the &ldquo;what.&rdquo;</p><p>And critically: it knows when to stop. Big architectural decisions? Woz waits. Things that need judgment? That&rsquo;s my job. Woz has boundaries, and it respects them.</p><h2 id=what-i-actually-use-it-for-today>What I Actually Use It For (Today)</h2><p>Let&rsquo;s be honest: the overnight PR factory is the vision. We&rsquo;re not quite there yet.</p><p>Right now, I use Woz for the mundane. The day-to-day friction that slows you down:</p><ul><li><strong>Code reviews.</strong> Woz reads a PR, thinks about it, and gives thoughtful feedback. Real feedback, not AI-generated buzzwords.</li><li><strong>Jumping between projects.</strong> I work across multiple repos (brisket, pilaf, the blog you&rsquo;re reading). Woz keeps track of what each project needs — the node version, the framework, the current state of things.</li><li><strong>One-off tasks.</strong> Build this, fix that, research this thing, write this documentation. Tasks that don&rsquo;t fit neatly into a sprint but need to get done.</li><li><strong>Thinking partner.</strong> Sometimes I just want to talk through an idea. Woz listens, asks good questions, pushes back when needed.</li></ul><h2 id=why-this-works>Why This Works</h2><p>A lot of people have tried building AI assistants. Most of them feel like talking to a chatbot. They lack context. They lack judgment. They make weird decisions.</p><p>Woz works because of three things:</p><p><strong>First: context.</strong> It has access to my actual code, my actual projects, my actual setup. It&rsquo;s not guessing. When I ask &ldquo;what&rsquo;s the current state of brisket,&rdquo; it can tell me — the node version, the structure, what we&rsquo;re working on.</p><p><strong>Second: personality.</strong> I gave it a soul. Not a marketing persona, an actual soul. It knows it&rsquo;s supposed to be succinct but thorough. It knows it should respect the codebase. It knows when to ask for direction and when to just do the work. It knows it&rsquo;s not supposed to be flashy; it&rsquo;s supposed to be reliable.</p><p><strong>Third: boundaries.</strong> It knows what it can&rsquo;t do. It doesn&rsquo;t push to main. It doesn&rsquo;t make big architectural calls alone. It doesn&rsquo;t break things. These constraints actually make it <em>better</em> at what it does, because I trust it more.</p><h2 id=the-overnight-workflow-coming-soon>The Overnight Workflow (Coming Soon)</h2><p>Here&rsquo;s the vision: somewhere in the future, Woz is smart enough to find tickets marked &ldquo;easy&rdquo; or &ldquo;good first issue,&rdquo; understand what they&rsquo;re asking for, and create a PR for them. Not every ticket — just the ones it can actually handle. The ones where the decision is clear and the work is straightforward.</p><p>I wake up, I get my morning coffee, and there&rsquo;s a PR waiting. Five lines of code, a clear explanation of what was wrong and how it&rsquo;s fixed. Takes me two minutes to review. Takes Woz four hours to write and test properly.</p><p>That&rsquo;s the dream.</p><h2 id=the-reality>The Reality</h2><p>Building Woz taught me something useful: you can&rsquo;t just throw an AI at a problem and expect it to work. You have to <em>design</em> the system. You have to give it structure, boundaries, context, and a clear sense of purpose.</p><p>Most AI assistants fail because they&rsquo;re built like consumer products — generic, trying to be everything, optimized for the chat. Woz works because it&rsquo;s built like <em>infrastructure</em> — specific, focused, optimized for a real workflow.</p><p>It&rsquo;s not going to replace developers. But it might just make development less annoying.</p><p>And honestly? That&rsquo;s worth something.</p><hr><p><em>Woz is built on <a href=https://openclaw.ai>OpenClaw</a>, a personal AI operating system that I highly recommend if you spend your time writing code and managing projects. It&rsquo;s still early, but the foundation is solid.</em></p></div><div class=prev-next></div></div></main><footer class=footer><span>Made with &#10084;&#65039; using <a target=_blank href=https://github.com/gokarna-theme/gokarna-hugo>Gokarna</a></span></footer></body></html>
